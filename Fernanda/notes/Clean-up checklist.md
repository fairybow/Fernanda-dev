# Clean-up checklist

(This is not definitive or finished.)

- Members should be prefixed with `m_`
- Static members should be prefixed with `s_`
- Casing:
	- Functions, members, args: `camelCase` (or `m_camelCase`)
	- Classes, structs, enums: `PascalCase`
	- Local variables: `snake_case`
	- `constexpr`s: `SCREAMING_SNAKE`
	- Macros: can vary depending on usage, but would generally also be `SCREAMING_SNAKE`
- Check that `#include`s are kept to the `.cpp` file where possible.
- Includes should be grouped into 3 A-Z groups: **Me**, **You**, and **Them**. **Me** means files like `Fernanda.h`; **You** means from outside libraries, as in `<QWidget>` or `<Windows.h>`; and **Them** means from the C/C++ standard library.
- Use `Q_OBJECT` for, obviously, signals/slots, but also if you want a function like `QWidget::parent()`, where the `parent` is a custom subclass, to output the subclass's name (instead of the inherited class's name) in console.
- Order of access specifiers:
	- `public`
	- `public slots`
	- `protected`
	- `private`
	- `private slots`
	- `signals`
	- `private` (developer/test functions, if needed)
- Order of header items
	- public:
		- any enums used as constructor arg
		- constructor/destructor
		- enums/structs/members
		- functions
			- operator overloads
			- values/info (e.g. `bool isEmpty()` or `QList<QWidget*> widgets()`)
			- getter/setter pairs
			- anything else that isn't a slot (grouped by action/idea/object/whatever)
	- private
		- enums/structs/members
		- functions
			- setup functions
			- same as above
- Slots should use the naming scheme `on[ChildObject]Signalled`, such as `onCurrentChanged` for a `QTabBar` self-connection to the `currentChanged` signal, or `onQTabBarCurrentChanged` for a `PageArea`'s slot for its `QTabBar`'s signal.
- Public slots may vary, like `setCurrentIndex(int index)`.
- Prefer using readable enums over bools for arguments where logical. That is, reading `updateCounts(true)` provides no context outside of an IDE, whereas `updateCounts(Force::Yes)` is pretty clear; however, things like `setVisible(true)` are plenty good.
